# RAYLIB

- Graphical front ends for the Witness clone written in Raylib C++.
- `demo.cpp` shows a looping demo of randomly generated grids and the auto-solver.
- `game.cpp` is a playable version. CONTROLS - LMB to start a drawing, RMB to cancel and move on to the next puzzle when solved.

# HOW TO USE

- Download the actual backend which is in the outermost file of this repo, and place them into a folder of your choosing.
- Put the cpp and header files in the same folder as the outermost files.
- Make sure that Raylib is installed and then build as needed.

# BUILDING

- Use a Quickstart as a template. Replace the `main.c` file with either `demo` or `game` renamed to `main.cpp`.
