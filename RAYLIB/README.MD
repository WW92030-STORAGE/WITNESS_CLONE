# RAYLIB

- Graphical front ends for the Witness clone written in Raylib C++.
- `demo.cpp` shows a looping demo of randomly generated grids and the auto-solver.
- `game.cpp` is a playable version. CONTROLS - LMB to start a drawing, RMB to cancel and move on to the next puzzle when solved.

# HOW TO USE

- Download the actual backend which is in the outermost file of this repo, and place them into a folder of your choosing.
- Put the cpp and header files in the same folder as the outermost files. (If you are on Windows you will also need the dll files.)
- Make sure Raylib is installed and then build the application.
- If you're on VSCode you can do CTRL+SHIFT+P to open the Command Palette and then `Run Task --> Build (Debug/Release)`.
